# Dr Sharp

> A code-agnostic documentation generator

## About

Dr Sharp will help you document your code without using any compilation tool.
It simply parses the comments in your code. This means you can document multiple
different language in one go.

The downside is that the documentation comments must differ a bit from the
conventional syntax (ex: jsdoc) because Dr Sharp needs more information since
it does not read the code itself.

Dr Sharp is not a parser. It's a tool which takes parsers and generators and
allow them to communicate. Such parsers and generators can be written by you,
giving the developer the liberty to use whatever documentation syntax they want.
